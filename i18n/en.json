The self developed parsing engine and typesetting engine are used to make the recognition effect and typesetting ability more intelligent, faster and more friendly</p><h2>About Circle Reading Assistant</h2><p>Is it really so difficult to read because there are too many distractions in advertisements, too ugly color matching, too small fonts to see clearly, and too messy typesetting to find the text</p><p>Is there any product that can extract and rearrange the content in the webpage and render it into a more readable typesetting interface</p><p>There are many products that can do this. The biggest problem with such products is that the text recognition effect is too poor. Failure in recognition, recognition of non text, omission of text, omission of main image, image splitting, etc. are common. In my opinion, the Safari browser of Apple is the best one. Even Safari browsers have more or less such problems. In addition, the setting interface of Safari is too simple and the customization type is not flexible enough</p><p>In order to solve the above common problems, Circle Reading Assistant was born. The reading assistant, which is more powerful than Safari reading mode, is the extension and improvement of the browser's own reading mode; It is the best tool for computer to read web pages, novels and news; It has shortcut key support, custom style, custom font, custom theme, automatic scrolling, automatic loading of the next page, reading aloud, article outline, returning to the top, reading in columns, printing pages formatted in the reading mode, and supporting browser's own translation and other reading auxiliary functions</p><p>The self developed parsing engine makes parsing faster and more intelligent. Self developed typesetting engine can automatically shield advertisements and noises on html</p><p>Powerful and intelligent recognition algorithm, friendly and comfortable typesetting interface, easy to use operation, flexible and rich configuration, all together make Circle Reading Assistant</p><h2>Real user evaluation</h2><p>Wenhai *: Very good! It is simple and easy to use.<strong>The analysis is very fast</strong>! Don't complicate it!! I've been looking for N for a long time. It's true. I've been looking for reading plug-ins every few years. Only this one best meets my needs~</p><p>Andong Wang： Awesome！ Apple is used to Safari's reading mode. Once I used this plug-in, I knew it was what I wanted.<strong>Simplicity</strong>,<strong>Beauty</strong></p><p>Yanyan su: It's worth five stars' recommendation. It's not much simpler than Jane Yue! I hope the author can perform the export function</p><p>Chuanliang zang: Reader View, Jane Yue... and several other reading modes are in use. Now only the first two are retained. Jane Yue can't return the money because of the complexity of the functions. Usually, Reader View uses more. I tried Circle just now, and I fell in love with it. My favorite is that I can easily adjust the page width, line spacing, and paragraph spacing (!!), Extremely recommended</p><p>Aione: i used a similar plug-in before, foreign, very comfortable. This is similar to the one I used before< br>  I'm not here to recommend the previous plug-in. I mean, it's not easy to meet such a good plug-in</p><p>Aeon Khronos: It is recommended by a small number of software, and it is really easy to use< Strong>Like</strong></p><p>LI Yi: Very quickly and concisely, thank the developer! Very much looking forward to the black and white list~</p><p>Zeng Xiao*: Small, beautiful and efficient</p><h2>Problem feedback</h2><p>Suggestions, product defects and any other issues can be found in the<a href=\"https://support.qq.com/products/317910\">Here</a>feedback</p><h2>Support me</h2><p>If you think the Circle Reading Assistant is good, you are welcome to upgrade to an advanced account to support our better development.
