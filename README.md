# Co-build Circle Reader

The current repository contains internationalized translations of the Circle Reader. If there is a language you are familiar with, please take the time to improve our internationalized translations and bring the Circle Reading Assistant to the world.

**If you are not familiar with the GITHUB submission process, you can copy the translation files and send them to me at wenguang.fe@gmail.com, and I will merge them.**

## Introduction

Internationalized translation files can be found in the i18n folder

Currently, we support zh_CN Chinese, zh_TW Traditional Chinese, en English, ja Japanese, ko Korean, and th Thai. If you don't have a language you are familiar with, you can copy the zh_CN.json file and rename it to the internal file of the translation of the language you are familiar with and then submit it.
